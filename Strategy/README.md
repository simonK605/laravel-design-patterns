# Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable.
The pattern allows a client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime, providing flexibility and promoting code modularity.

# Advantages
* Flexibility: The Strategy pattern allows for the dynamic selection of algorithms at runtime, promoting flexibility in the system.
* Modularity: Each strategy is encapsulated in its own class, promoting code modularity and ease of maintenance.
* Extensibility: Adding new strategies does not require modifying existing code, making the system easy to extend.

# Considerations
* Complexity: While the Strategy pattern provides flexibility, it may introduce additional complexity, especially for simple systems where strategies rarely change.
