# Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, known as observers, that are notified of any changes in the subject's state.
This pattern is widely used in event handling systems and scenarios where multiple components need to react to changes in another component's state.

# Advantages
* Loose Coupling: The Observer pattern promotes loose coupling between the subject and its observers, making it easy to extend and maintain the system.
* Flexibility: Observers can be added or removed dynamically, allowing for flexibility in the system's design.
* Event Handling: Commonly used in event handling systems where multiple components need to react to changes.

# Considerations
* Performance: If not implemented carefully, notifying multiple observers can impact performance. Consider optimizations if necessary.
