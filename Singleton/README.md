# Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

# Advantages
* Single Instance: Ensures that a class has only one instance, reducing memory usage and avoiding conflicts.
* Global Access: Provides a global point of access to the instance, making it easy to use throughout the application.
* Lazy Initialization: The instance is created only when needed, improving performance.

# Considerations
* Global State: The use of singletons introduces global state, which can make the code harder to test and maintain.
* Thread Safety: In multithreaded environments, special attention is needed to ensure proper thread safety when implementing a singleton.
