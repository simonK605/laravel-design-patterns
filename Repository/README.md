# Repository Pattern

The Repository pattern is a design pattern that separates the logic that retrieves data from the underlying storage (such as a database) from the business logic of the application.
It provides a clean and organized way to interact with data, promoting code modularity and testability.

# Advantages
* Separation of Concerns: The Repository pattern separates data access logic from the rest of the application, promoting clean and organized code.
* Testability: Repositories make it easier to test the application's business logic without touching the database.
* Flexibility: Changes to the data access logic (e.g., switching databases) can be isolated to the repository.

# Considerations
* Complexity: For small applications, the Repository pattern might introduce unnecessary complexity. Use it when the benefits outweigh the added abstraction.
